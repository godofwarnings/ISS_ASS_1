# THE FORMATTING WAS VERY POORLY DESCRIBED AND HENCE I HAVE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL MY ASSUMPTIONS. I HAD MELTDOWN ON TUESDAY AND I CAN'T JUST KEEP CHANGING MY FILE STRUCTURES AND OUPUT FORMATTING AS IT SUITS YOU. PLEASE BEAR WITH IT.

I have included the quotes.txt file for reference.

## Question 1

The answer to question 1 and 2 have been outputted to the terminal seperated as Part A and Part B as well as separate files named q1_a.txt and q1_b.txt. </br>
The question was attempted assuming they were in succession i.e. answer to part a was used as input to part b. </br>

## Question 2

The result is output to a file named q2.txt and the original file, quotes.txt was used and not the resulting file from part b of Q1. The empty lines were removed too.

## Question 3

Enter the complete file name when running any of the five scripts. For eg: quotes.txt </br>
The output of part a, b, c is output to terminal and for e and d, result was output to q3-d.txt q3-e.txt </br>
For part d, I have not removed empty lines. If the lines were empty, 0 words were output. </br>
Since it wasn't mentioned not to show frequencies of individual characters, I included that too. For eg, if I appeared by itself, then its frequency is also shown. I have printed frequncies of only repeating strings.</br>

## Question 4

Give numbers as space separated integers. The output is displayed on the terminal itself.

## Question 5

Enter a single string. For eg:  Helloo </br>
Part C requires that you give an even length string. Even though it was mentioned in the assignment, I'm again mentioning it. </br>
The output is shown on terminal itself.
